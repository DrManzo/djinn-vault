# QUEUE — Djinn Task Queue

Claude (or Javier) writes tasks here. Salomon and Typhon pull and execute.

## Rules
- **Append only** — never delete entries. Mark `status: done` or `status: failed`.
- `trigger: auto` — runner picks up on next poll (cron every 5 min)
- `trigger: manual` — runner skips; Javier must send explicit signal
- Runner: `djinn-queue-runner` on Salomon and Typhon
- On completion: runner calls `djinn-task-complete TASK-NNN "summary"` automatically

## Task Format

```
## TASK-NNN
- assigned_to: salomon | typhon
- status: pending | in_progress | done | failed
- priority: critical | high | normal | low
- trigger: auto | manual
- created: YYYY-MM-DD by Claude|Javier
- context: one-line description of what and why

**Commands:**
```bash
command one
command two
```
```

## TASK-004
- assigned_to: claude
- status: pending
- priority: high
- trigger: manual
- created: 2026-05-31 by Salomon (per Javier)
- context: Fix maker's mark mirroring on bottom engraving + make it configurable

**Bug:** When the TF anvil STL (logo faces +Z) is boolean-subtracted from a vase bottom and viewed from below, the engraving reads reversed. Need to mirror X axis before subtract.

**Fix required in the workflow:**
1. Mirror maker's mark across X axis before boolean subtraction into bottom surfaces (`mirrored_verts[:, 0] = -mirrored_verts[:, 0]` + reverse face winding)
2. Make maker's mark a configurable variable — default `tf_anvil_traced_15mm.stl`, stored in `~/.config/djinn/makers-mark.json` with `{ "path": "...", "mirror_x": true }`
3. Document the rule so all agents know to mirror before engraving on bottom faces

**Files:**
- `/home/drmanzo/Downloads/files/tf_anvil_traced_15mm.stl` — default mark
- `~/.config/djinn/ender3-v3-plus.ini` — printer profile  
- `/home/drmanzo/.local/bin/djinn-print-consult` — consult script
- `/home/drmanzo/Obsidian/djinn/printer/SUPPORT-GUIDE.md` — workflow docs

**Report back:** Post fix summary in COMMS.md + update `build-log.md`.
