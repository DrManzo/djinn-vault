# QUEUE — Djinn Task Queue

Claude (or Javier) writes tasks here. Salomon and Typhon pull and execute.

## Rules
- **Append only** — never delete entries. Mark `status: done` or `status: failed`.
- `trigger: auto` — runner picks up on next poll (cron every 5 min)
- `trigger: manual` — runner skips; Javier must send explicit signal
- Runner: `djinn-queue-runner` on Salomon and Typhon
- On completion: runner calls `djinn-task-complete TASK-NNN "summary"` automatically

## Task Format

```
## TASK-NNN
- assigned_to: salomon | typhon
- status: pending | in_progress | done | failed
- priority: critical | high | normal | low
- trigger: auto | manual
- created: YYYY-MM-DD by Claude|Javier
- context: one-line description of what and why

**Commands:**
```bash
command one
command two
```
```

systemctl --user is-active djinn-shop-dashboard.service
systemctl --user is-active djinn-dm-cleanup.timer
grep -q "SHOP_PATCH_APPLIED" ~/.local/bin/djinn-discord-gateway && echo "Discord patched OK" || echo "Discord NOT patched"

```

**Report back:** Post djinn-shop-deploy output + verification results in COMMS.md.

- trigger: manual

**Commands:**
```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /home/drmanzo/.local/bin/djinn-queue-runner >> /tmp/djinn-queue.log 2>&1") | crontab -
