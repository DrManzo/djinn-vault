## 2026-05-22: Phase 9 — Printer Node (Ender-3 V3 Plus) — In Progress

- Klipper + Moonraker: already live on Nebula pad (`192.168.1.114:7125`) — no Typhon install needed
- `plr.cfg` uploaded to printer: Power Loss Recovery + thermal watchdog (5s poll, saves Z+layer, pauses on temp drop)

## 2026-05-24: Manufacturing Orchestrator + Coin + FairPrintAgent

**Typhon's Forge Challenge Coin (2026-05-23)**
- 38mm × 4.5mm challenge coin designed from PNG logo
- Pipeline: PNG → PBM (ImageMagick) → SVG (potrace) → OpenSCAD parts → trimesh merge
- Final: LOGO_SCALE=0.0448 (20% reduction to stop corner text clipping), text size=3.8
- Key discoveries: OpenSCAD CGAL union() silently fails on 1M-face meshes; SVG center must be measured from rendered STL not SVG header
- Build report: `djinn/printer/library/typhons-forge-coin/COIN_BUILD_REPORT.md`

**FairPrintAgent / djinn-print-quote (2026-05-23)**
- Commission pricing CLI: `(material + time + design) / 0.60`
- Library auto-detect: design cost → $0 if piece name matches library folder
- Market fetch: ddgs DuckDuckGo/Etsy search
- Full agent mode: weighted cost+market blend, 4 job types
- OpenClaw: `quote`, `quick quote` command handlers added

**Print Job #1 — mario pipe + 4 coins (2026-05-24)**
- Combined plate: proxy_parts_mario_pipe + 4× Typhon's Forge coins
- PrusaSlicer silently dropped pipe when combined STL exceeded ~200MB
- Fix: decimate coins to 15k faces with pymeshlab → plate = 3.3MB → sliced correctly
- 3h 20m / 59.8g — started 2026-05-24

**Six-Agent Manufacturing Orchestrator (2026-05-24)**
- Package: `djinn/printer/agent/orchestrator/`
- Agents: DesignGenAgent, DesignEditAgent, ProtoOptAgent, DOEPrintOptAgent, PlateNestAgent (all live)
- CLI: `djinn-design` at `~/.local/bin/djinn-design`
- Venv: `~/.venvs/djinn-orchestrator/` (Python 3.11 — anthropic, pyDOE2, trimesh, pymeshlab, scipy)
- DOE engine verified: -76% time / -51% material for prototype_fast vs standard settings
- OpenClaw: `design`, `design edit`, `design optimize`, `design doe`, `design plate`, `design status` handlers

## 2026-05-24: Djinn Media Stack — 9-Agent Instagram Production Suite

- 9 OpenClaw agents registered: content-orchestrator, ingest, video-edit, photo-edit, caption, repurpose, thumbnail, publish-prep, qa
- 8 CLI tools at `~/.local/bin/djinn-media-*` (ffmpeg + ImageMagick + Pillow + faster-whisper)
- Shared skills: project-intake, platform-export, clip-packaging, thumbnail-brief, qc-checklist
- Shared schemas: project-manifest.json, export-package.json
- Brand voice + platform rules prompts for Typhon's Forge Instagram
- faster-whisper installed (pyenv 3.11) for audio transcription
- llama3.2-vision called via REST from thumbnail and photo agents (frame scoring)
- openclaw.json updated: 3 → 12 total agents
- Vault doc: `djinn/media/MEDIA-STACK.md`
- Smoke test: logo → ingest → photo edit → QA → 6/6 PASS
- **Report Standard standardized** — PROTOCOL.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md all updated with mandatory reporting requirement

## 2026-05-25: FairPrintAgent — Bug Fix + First Live Validation

- First end-to-end test against real print data (Mario Pipe: 44g, 3.33h)
- Full JSON mode: $11.70 fair market, 5 Etsy comps fetched live
- Coin preset: $92.91 cost floor, 3 comps — confirmed functional
- Fixed `--quick` crash on piped stdin: TTY guard + EOF handling added
- `--simple` mode confirmed working; noted labor/machine-time conflation issue

## 2026-05-25: LUT Pipeline, Hashtag Bank, Style Scraper

- **djinn-lut-gen** — generates forge/clean/moody .cube LUT files (33³ points, 947KB each) to shared luts dir
- **djinn-media-photo** rewritten — ffmpeg + lut3d filter replaces ImageMagick curve math; vision QC via llama3.2-vision; clean product names from quoted notes
- **djinn-media-reel** updated — lut_filter() replaces inline curves; --combine flag for multi-clip concat
- **djinn-style-scrape** — DuckDuckGo reference scraper, 8 queries, 32 images on initial run; populates references/scraped/
- **Hashtag bank** — 11 files, 236 tags; 3d-printing/cannabis/brand/crossover/platform-rules categories
- **djinn-hashtag-update** — bank manager: --report, --research (phi4:14b), --add, --dump; weekly systemd timer
- **djinn-media-publish-prep** — draft-polish mode (quoted text → qwen2.5:7b), tag validation, plain .txt exports, Drive includes publish/+video/+feed/, Discord plain-text with Drive link
- Bug fixes: QA reel_cover false positive, feed manifest clobbering, Discord CloudFlare 403, hallucinated hashtags, caption blockquote markdown
- openclaw.json: 14 agents (added style-scraper-agent)
- Gateway restarted, all 14 agents active

## 2026-05-25: FairPrintAgent — --simple mode labor/machine fix

- Added `MACHINE_RATE_PER_HOUR` constant (~$0.20/hr: electricity + depreciation + maintenance)
- `--simple` now separates machine runtime cost from human labor cost
- Added `--labor` flag (minutes, default 20) for hands-on prep/post time
- Mario Pipe result: $112.77 → $14.01 (aligned with full formula $11.70 and market $15.09)

## 2026-05-25: GoPro Tripod 3MF — Flip, Support Fix, Print Preflight

- `GoPro_Tripod_flipped.3mf` — both pieces flipped 180° around X (screw holes now open upward, no support packing)
- Support threshold fixed: 20° → 45° in embedded project_settings.config (root cause of holes breaking on cleanup)
- Brim: outer_brim confirmed
- **`djinn-model-slice`** — added `preflight_3mf_check()`: runs on every .3mf before slice, flags support threshold <35°, supports-on + aggressive threshold, layer height extremes, no brim, very low infill — sends warnings to Telegram + Discord before job starts

*— Claude*

## 2026-05-25: djinn-model-slice — Extended preflight to all file types

- Added `parse_ini_settings()` + `preflight_profile_check()` for STL/OBJ/STEP files
- Profile check reads `ender3-v3-plus.ini` and applies same flags: support threshold, supports+threshold combo, layer height, brim, infill
- `.gcode` files get a "settings baked in" advisory
- `.3mf` still uses embedded settings (those override the profile)
- Smoke test: profile reads clean except expected brim_width=0 warning

## 2026-05-25: FairPrintAgent — Smoking/dab category market fetch

- Added `SMOKING_KEYWORDS` set and `is_smoking_item()` detection
- Smoking items now use dab/puffco-specific search queries targeting etsy.com dab categories + thesmokeshopguys.com
- `SMOKING_SOURCES` list baked in from Javier's reference URLs
- Trusted sources (etsy + thesmokeshopguys) get 0.85 similarity vs 0.60 for others
- Tested on Puffco Proxy Bubbler: correctly hits smoking category, $18.37 cost floor

*— Claude*

## 2026-05-25: FairPrintAgent — --size small|large for smoking pieces

- Added `--size small|large` flag — splits fetched comps into bottom/top half
- `small`: low-mid price comps (accessories, stands, organizers)
- `large`: mid-high price comps (full pieces, custom rigs, bubblers)
- Works in full agent formula (JSON mode) only — simple mode doesn't fetch comps
- Tested: Puffco Proxy Bubbler small=$18.37 floor, large=$21.67 fair market
- Fixed argparse crash on Python 3.14 (≤ char in help string → pct)
